# Slug Grub Hub

This project aims to make it easier for UCSC students to know when their favorite foods are available at any dining hall during each week/day. For example, if one really wanted to know when the elusive fried mac and cheese bites were available at College Nine/Ten's dining hall, they could know which day of the week it would be available and at what time (breakfast, lunch, or dinner).

This project serves as a learning experience for me in learning how to apply my knowledge of Python towards a project, how to data scrape, and how to use different APIs to accomplish certain tasks within an application.

The end goal is for this project to help people who I know at UCSC. This will start with me having my close friends be users. After they try it out and give feedback, I will open Slug Grub Hub use to anyone who wants to use it.

As of early October, UCSC has updated their dining hall website in a way that makes it harder to web scrape (returns an error 500 message when scraping). Slug Grub Hub is currently being updated to accomodate these changes, and will be fixed soon.

Side Note: Slug Grub Hub has no association with the company Grub Hub. Originally SGH was supposed to just be "Slug Grub," but I had forgotten about Grub Hub's name. I believed adding the "Hub" part would make it sound better (I still believe this), and thus this project maintains the name of Slug Grub Hub.
