# Slug Grub Hub

This project aims to make it easier for UCSC students to know when their favorite foods are available at any dining hall during each week/day. For example, if one really wanted to know when the elusive fried mac and cheese bites were available at college nine/ten's dining hall, they could know which day of the week it would be available and at what time (breakfast, lunch, or dinner).

Initially, Slug Grub Hub will start as a script that can be run on a Rasberry Pi to text a list of users a schedule of their favorite foods at the beginning of the week, and then a text on the day of when their favorite foods are available.

This project has been worked on since mid August, with version control added in mid September. This project serves as a learning experience for me in learning how to apply my knowledge of Python towards a project, how to data scrape, and how to use different APIs to accomplish certain tasks within an application.

The end goal of the project is to have the script done by the end of September, and have a Google Home action and Amazon Alexa skill that has similar functionality to the script done by early to mid October. Thank you for your patience, and I can't wait until it's done!
